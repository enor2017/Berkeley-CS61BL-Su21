Version 2.0 7/6/2017.

This directory contains a skeleton for CS61B Project 0.

Although some of what's in here might seem mysterious to you, try to
understand what it's all for.  Don't be afraid to ask us about it.

GENERAL NOTE:  EVERYTHING in these files is changeable as you see fit, unless
   otherwise noted.  Your task is to conform to the spec, period.  While
   we have suggested, with these files, certain points about the design, we
   don't require any of it.

Makefile               For those of you using the standard Unix tool chain
                       rather than Eclipse, this file provides for some
                       simple compilation/testing control.  See the
                       comments in it for the targets provided.  Those of
                       you using Eclipse will need it on the instructional
                       machines (the commands 'make' and 'make check' must
                       work correctly on your submission, regardless of
                       which editor or IDE you used).

    Makefile           A Makefile for compiling, style checking, testing, and
                       cleaning up files in this directory.

    Main.java          Entry point to program. This handles program options
                       and sets up the necessary objects to play one or more
                       games.

    Model.java         This class describes game state: the contents of the
                       board and the scores.  It contains the logic for
                       tilting the board so that tiles slide to new positions.

    Tile.java          Describes a single tile on the board.

    Side.java          An enumeration type for the directions in which the
                       board can tilt.  Contains functions that allow you to
                       change the coordinate system---to treat any side of
                       the board as "south" with rows and columns rotated
                       accordingly.

    Game.java          Contains the logic for controlling a game: responding
                       to commands by updating the model as appropriate.

    InputSource.java   An interface to get input to the game, which consists of
                       keystrokes and random tile positions.  It has two
                       implementing subtypes: GUISource and TestSource.

    GUISource.java     An InputSource that fetches inputs from a user's
                       key presses and generates tiles using a
                       pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).

    TestSource.java    An InputSource that fetches recorded key presses and
                       tile positions from a file, allowing you to create
                       and run tests.

    GUI.java           Represents the graphical display of the game state and
                       receives key presses from the user.  The GUI
                       "observes" the model and responds to changes in it.

    BoardWidget.java   Used by GUI to represent the grid of squares and tiles.

    BoardLogger.java   Another observer of the game state that prints the
                       states of the board to a file, thus allowing one to
                       capture and check the board positions generated by
                       the program.

testing/                 Directory with integration test machinery.

    tester.py          A Python 3 script for testing your program.  It makes
                       use of the --testing option in your program to feed
                       in known moves.
    testing.py         A module that supports testing in general.
    *.in               Test scripts accepted by the tester.
    *.out              The outputs (logged by BoardLogger) expected for each
                       test.
